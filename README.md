# Deer Tracker

Identify and track deer using trail cameras and object detection.

Trail cameras will be manually geocoded by user.

User chooses geocoded trail camera when importing trail camera photos.

Modify EXIF photo data with trail camera geocode.

User will have option to review object labels from image after AI predictions.

Each photo EXIF should contain:

* Geolocation
* Date time
* Object detection data (model version, object tags, user tags

Each deer identity, geolocation, and time will be tracked and visualized.

Interpolated paths will be drawn on map linking each deer identity's geocoded data points in time order.

Photo import process:
  Choose photos,
  Associate batch with saved camera location
  Tag photo with geolocation.
  Date Times are based on photo metadata
  Model runs deer tagging, user can correct
  Tag photo with model prediction, becomes training data.

Feature to retrain model based on user tags
